**Containerization** allows applications to run in isolated environments called containers. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host OS kernel but have their own file system, network, and process space.

## Key Concepts:
- **Docker**: A popular platform for containerization.
- **Images**: Immutable snapshots defining a container's contents.
- **Containers**: Instances of Docker images running in isolated environments.
- **Registry**: A repository for Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).

## Benefits:
- **Lightweight**: Containers are smaller and faster than VMs.
- **Consistency**: Ensures the same behavior across environments.
- **Efficiency**: Uses fewer resources by sharing the OS kernel.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications by spinning up more containers.

### History of Containerization
- **1979**: Unix chroot introduced file system isolation.
- **2000s**: Linux introduced containers with cgroups and namespaces.
- **2013**: Docker revolutionized containerization with its platform.
- **Present**: Containerization is critical for microservices and DevOps.
