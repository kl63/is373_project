title: Threading
---

**Threading** allows a single process to perform multiple tasks simultaneously using separate threads.

- **Benefits**:
  - **Improved Performance**: By running multiple threads in parallel, applications can complete tasks more quickly, making better use of available CPU resources.
  - **Responsiveness**: Threads can handle multiple operations at once, improving the responsiveness of applications, especially in interactive or real-time systems.

- **How It Works**:
  - **Shared Memory**: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, allowing them to access and modify shared data. This facilitates communication between threads but also requires careful management.
  - **Thread Management**: Proper management is needed to avoid conflicts such as race conditions (where threads access shared data simultaneously) and deadlocks (where threads wait indefinitely for resources held by each other). Techniques like synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, semaphores) are used to manage access to shared resources and ensure thread safety.
