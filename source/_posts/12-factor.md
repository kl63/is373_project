The Twelve-Factor App methodology defines best practices for building scalable and maintainable SaaS applications:

1. **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys.  
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.  
3. **Config**: Store config in the environment.  
4. **Backing services**: Treat backing services as attached resources.  
5. **Build, release, run**: Separate build and run stages.  
6. **Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.  
7. **Port binding**: Export services via port binding.  
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model.  
9. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.  
10. **Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production environments similar.  
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams.  
12. **Admin processes**: Run admin tasks as one-off processes.
